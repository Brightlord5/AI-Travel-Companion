The "AI Travel Companion" app is designed to be a comprehensive travel planning assistant. When users input their chosen city and the number of days they plan to spend there, the app generates a customized itinerary for each day. Leveraging AI, it suggests must-visit places and optimizes routes to ensure efficient exploration.

Key Features:

- Day-by-Day Itineraries: Users input the number of days they will be staying in the city. The app then provides a unique itinerary for each day, ensuring a well-paced and enjoyable travel experience.
- AI-Powered Suggestions: Utilizing an LLM, the app generates a list of must-visit places based on the number of days available. This ensures that travelers make the most of their time and don't miss out on key attractions.
- Optimized Routing: Employing advanced pathfinding algorithms, the app calculates the shortest route for each day's itinerary, covering all recommended places. This minimizes travel time and maximizes exploration.
Visualized on Maps: The optimized routes are visually presented on interactive maps, allowing users to easily follow their daily journeys.
- Google Maps Integration: A seamless Google Maps navigation link is provided for each day's itinerary, making on-the-ground navigation effortless.
- Future Scope:
Customizable: Users can customize their itineraries by adding or removing places, ensuring the app suits their unique interests and preferences.
Add Stops and Breaks for food: The app could suggest nearby restaurants or cafes for meals, as well as rest stops for breaks.

The "AI Travel Companion" project applies AI techniques, including natural language processing and search algorithms, to transform travel planning. It aims to enhance travelers' experiences by providing efficient, personalized, and informative guidance as they explore new cities.
